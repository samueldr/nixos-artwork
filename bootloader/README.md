Bootloader artwork
==================

This directory holds the artwork used for the NixOS bootloaders.


`isolinux`
-----------

A bootloader for legacy boot, specifically the ISO/USB image.

It is assumed it is of the SYSLINUX family, probably ISOLINUX.

Technically the ISOLINUX setup is to be configured to use a 800Ã—600 resolution.
This resolution ensures a maximum number of machines to be compatible, and
still allows enough definition.

It is also assumed that legacy boot **is not really used anymore**. Most recent
hardware will be using the UEFI bootloader. This is why the image is made
assuming 4:3 aspect ratio; most of the legacy boot uses are assumed to be on
virtual machines, where the bootloader will be shown with square pixels.


`refind`
--------

A bootloader for (U)EFI boot. While not generally used with NixOS, a first
draft for a themed UEFI bootloader is made using refind.


### `refind/icons`

Icons are from or adapted from the breeze icons projects of KDE, available
